**Hi, I'm `zihan`,  AI/ML Engineer**

* My excitement lies in exploring AI domains from ```LLM```, ```information retrieval(GNN)```, ```multimodal systems```, and ```machine perception```(3d point cloud and video understanding), NOW - with a special focus on ```vision-language``` tech and ```intelligent systems(LLM driven)``` using large semi-structured data.

* I have honed my ```Full Stack Web/Desktop/Mobile``` app development skills, allowing me to bring the projects to life and deliver end-to-end solutions.
