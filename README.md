**Hi, I'm `zihan`,  AI/ML Engineer**

* My excitement lies in exploring AI domains from ```LLM```, ```information retrieval(GNN)```, ```multimodal systems```, and ```machine perception```, NOW - with a special focus on ```vision-language``` tech and ```LLM post training``` using large semi-structured data.

* I have honed my ```Full Stack Web/Desktop/Mobile``` app development skills, allowing me to bring the projects to life and deliver end-to-end solutions.
