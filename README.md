🍀 **Hi, I'm `Bill`, Enthusiastic AI/ML Engineer ✍️**

* 🚀 Driven by my passion for machine learning and data science, I began crafting AI solutions and advanced to an algorithm R&D engineer role at ```DiDi```. Now, I'm thrilled to embark on the next exciting phase of my journey.

* 👁️ My excitement lies in exploring AI domains from ```NLP(DS-LLM)```, ```information retrieval(GNN)```, ```multimodal systems```, and ```machine perception```(3d point cloud and video understanding), NOW - with a special focus on ```vision-language``` tech and ```intelligent systems``` using large semi-structured data.

* 💻 I have honed my ```Full Stack Web/Desktop/Mobile``` app development skills, allowing me to bring the projects to life and deliver end-to-end solutions.

* 🗂️ I am the co-founder of the ```open source``` community ```Miracle Factory``` , eagering to connect with other members of the open source community and particularly interested in exploring new collaborations that can drive meaningful changes.
